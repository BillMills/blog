An old favorite of mine, Michael Faraday, started the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures as a way to introduce a novel topic in science to a public underserved by science education almost 200 years ago, in a very old swing at opening up the academy a little. The open science movement is faced with a similar problem today: how can we equip undergrads and grad students with the code and data skills they need to do open research, that are often not part of most curricula?

<a title="sgm" href="https://twitter.com/shauna_gm" target="_blank">Shauna Gordon-McKeon</a> and I have been discussing lately what would be involved in introducing the ideas, skills and practices of open science to university students in an event like her successful <a title="osctc" href="http://campus.openhatch.org/" target="_blank">Open Source Comes to Campus</a> series; more on this forthcoming event as it develops, but thinking along those lines today, I started wondering what open science education would look like as part of university curriculum and life.

There are plenty of questions to answer here, not the least of which is, 'exactly what do we mean when we say we want to teach open science?'. This bears plenty of discussion, but we can at least start from the simple goal of <em>enabling students to create reusable research objects, meant to be shared publicly and collaborated on, supporting automated and reproducible analyses</em>.

These are pretty bedrock open science values, but calling out even these limited basics begins to illustrate the constellation of things I'd like us to bring to students in a course offering:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic coding, database &amp; version control skills</strong>, like those taught in the array of coding workshops currently out there, are the foundations of automated and reproducible analyses.</li>
    <li><strong>High-level coding skills</strong> are needed to augment basic programming in order to build a community of collaboration and sharing. For example: collaboration requires trust, and strong trust is based on proof. How do you prove code is trustworthy? Write <strong>unit tests</strong>. Or another: as collaborators come to a project, how do you maintain a high standard of quality? A system of formal <strong>code review</strong> needs to be implemented. The list goes on; these are things that must be taught in order to actualize the collaborative goals of open science.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication skills</strong> are the unsung hero of open science. Code and data distributed freely on the web that no one can make any sense of is open in name only; all you can do is touch it, and not much else. Newcomers have to be able to get a working understanding of the research object in a reasonable (ie, very short) amount of time, or it isn't actually going to get reused. Skills like writing good <strong>documentation</strong>, clearly <strong>planning project</strong> scope and structure, and <strong>data hygiene</strong> are key to open science working in practice.</li>
</ul>

Once we have a curriculum sorted out, how are we going to deliver it?

<ul>
    <li>In a <strong>for-credit course</strong>? This gives us lots of time to discuss everything we ever wanted, but can be nearly impossible to wedge into already bursting degree programs.</li>
    <li>As <strong>part of an existing course</strong>? This can be a lot easier to pull off with the help of a professor who's on board, but risks having the new ideas marginalized by the traditional content of the course.</li>
    <li>As a<strong> directed studies course</strong>? Many programs have some form of supervised, for-credit project course; this could be a fantastic vehicle for students to gain experience and practice skills, but may be a bit light on instructional time, depending on how the course is designed.</li>
</ul>

There are tons more details to both these areas of consideration, and a whole bunch more things I haven't even touched on (for instance: what can we do outside the classroom but within the university community to foster open science practices?). But before I continue much further down my merry path of musings, I'd like to turn it over to you: <strong>how would you design and deliver a course or unit on open science to undergrads or grad students?

A number of you have contacted me recently about upcoming plans to teach open science in your university courses - here's an opportunity to share our plans and envision what this could look like together. I hope you'll join us!
